ITEM 334
Brand=Rapak®
Feature=Perfect for home winemakers who want to save space, aggravation, time and effort!  Enough bags to package entire 6 gallon kit! Feature=Open boxed wine can last six to eight weeks, and even longer if you keep it in the refrigerator. How long can you store an open bottle of red wine? Maybe 5 days. Not only does the plastic bib seal better than its glass counterpart, it's also environmentally friendly. Feature=Typically speaking, when you use Bag-In-Box, you'll enjoy a savings because the packaging costs less than bottles, corks, sleeves, is less work to bag your wine than bottling is, and stores better in less space. Feature=No special equipment needed to use! Feature=There are several consumer benefits to using Bag-In-Box for wines besides the green ones listed above. First of all, your wine will stay fresher than bottled wine after opening due to the lack of oxidation. Most Bag-In-Box wines suggest finishing the wine in 6 weeks or less to keep that fresh taste. That's much longer than an open bottle of wine in the refrigerator, which after one week usually has less flavor. And here's a really good benefit-Bag-In-Box wines are easy to open. There's no cork or corkscrew needed. No more pieces of cork floating in your wine glass!  And, as an added benefit, bag-in-box wines are much better for the environment due to the fact that they lower the carbon footprint dramatically!
