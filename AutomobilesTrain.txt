ITEM 10
Brand=FUEL OPTIMISER
Feature=Easy to install on any car - Gas or Diesel Feature=Installs on the fuel line - Must go under the car or locate fuel line under the engine bay. This item is not plug and play, because you need to install it on a fuel line feeding your engine. Feature=Increase gas mileage up to 24% results can vary Feature=We offer 30 day Money Back Guarantee. Please no negative feedback if you end up not installing or want a refund. We support our customers fully. Please contact us if any trouble. Feature=Installation: 1. First locate your fuel supply line that feeds the engine from the fuel tank. Most vehicles will have two lines running next to each other. There will be a supply line and a return line. Carefully, while the engine is turned on, in PARK, touch the fuel line and find the colder one. The colder fuel line is your fuel supply line. If it's very cold outside, your going have to install the product in a warmer garage. Otherwise, you can do a visual check determine which is your supply line. 2. Position the two parts of the fuel saver on opposite ends onto your fuel line. Use the built in screws to tighten.  Because of the cleaning and removal process of carbon deposits in your cylinders, the fuel consumption may increase during the beginning cleaning cycle. Your vehicles mileage will stabilize after a short period. You will see noticeable improvements after 3 full gas tanks or about 1000 miles. It is highly recommended that you insure your air filter is clean. If possible adding fuel cleaners to your gas tank will make the cleaning of your engine go faster. Improved performance and a smoother running engine will usually be noticed.

Feature=OEM Fitment and Warranty - KFE Brake Systems GUARANTEES PROPER FITMENT equal to or exceed any OE products. All products are backed up by our No Questions Asked 2 Years 24,000 miles Limited Warranty; please visit our website for more details. Feature=Low Noise - KFE Ultra Quiet Advance Brake Pads are equipped with Dual-Rubber Wolverine Shims which dramatically reduces and absorbs vibration. Since vibration is one of the leading causes of brake noise, these shims can REDUCE 20% MORE NOISE compared to conventional shims. The shims also act as a heat shield between the brake pads and the brake assembly. This function will help brake fluid temperature low and aids in proper function of the brake system. Feature=Less Brake-In Time - Thermo Scorched process burns off any excess uncured agents in the brake pad compound. During this course, the coefficient of friction stabilizes and NOISE causing agents are REDUCED. Another key advantage is this process during production eliminates the break-in time for your brake systems on public roads with other motorists, and police, amongst other hazards. Feature=Increase Brake Bite - Slots in the brake pad help clean the contact area between the brake pad and the rotor while simultaneously helping gas escape during the friction cycle. This will ENHANCE the driver's ABILITY TO BRAKE because of a more consistent and firm brake pedal feel. *Please check per your vehicle application; not all applications have slotted features. Feature=Long Life - Edges of brake pad can lift, causing brake noise and catastrophic brake failure. With chamfered edges both of these issues are drastically reduced. This feature will SAVE YOU MONEY by extending the life of your brake pad. It will also give you a more COMFORTABLE RIDE. *Please check per your vehicle application; not all applications have chamfered edge features.

Brand=BG
Feature=BG 44K\AE is the ultimate tank-treatment fuel system cleaner. It's 11 ounces of high quality detergents and additives that you pour right into the gas tank to restore performance and gas mileage. It vanquishes deposits in combustion chambers, intake manifolds, ports and on valves and restores flow in fuel injectors. Basically, it cleans the entire fuel system! Feature=Gasoline quality is inconsistent. And when gas at the pump is poor quality, it can cause deposit buildup, inefficient ignition and combustion and poor power output. To make matters worse, small, high output engines are extremely sensitive to deposits that build up on fuel injectors, intake ports, on intake valves and in combustion chambers. Even small amounts of deposits cause increased exhaust emissions, reduced fuel economy, drivability problems and engine knock.

Brand=BG
Feature=BG 44K\AE is the ultimate tank-treatment fuel system cleaner. It's 11 ounces of high quality detergents and additives that you pour right into the gas tank to restore performance and gas mileage. It vanquishes deposits in combustion chambers, intake manifolds, ports and on valves and restores flow in fuel injectors. Basically, it cleans the entire fuel system! Feature=Gasoline quality is inconsistent. And when gas at the pump is poor quality, it can cause deposit buildup, inefficient ignition and combustion and poor power output. To make matters worse, small, high output engines are extremely sensitive to deposits that build up on fuel injectors, intake ports, on intake valves and in combustion chambers. Even small amounts of deposits cause increased exhaust emissions, reduced fuel economy, drivability problems and engine knock.
